## Introduction

In response to the financial crisis of 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin whitepaper outlining the first decentralised public ledger technology to hit the world stage.
The network has stood strong to this day and inspired 1000s of projects build off of Satoshi's vision of a decentralised world. We now have a robust ecosystem of smart contract, NFT and decentralised financed platforms.
Pandora's box has been opened and there is no turning back.

One of the main benefits of cryptocurrencies is the public availability of the blockchain data. Previously corporations would protect vast silos of data in order to monetize it & increase their stranglehold on the market.
Public blockchains granted software developers to the ability to compete with much larger corporations by providing value to the user & not by monetizing siloed data.

Even though cryptocurrencies have been around for more than a decade, adoption rates are still relatively low. I believe this is due to the perceived complexity of the technology.
My goal for my Code Institute Milestone Project 3: Data Centric is to simplify the experience for the user by allowing them to view their blockchain data in a more intuitive graphical interface.

#### Current Blockchain Interfaces

This cryptocurrency dashboard project will mainly be interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum is the market leader in smart contract technology with the largest developer base.
Etherscan is the leading blockchain analysis tool which allows you to view transactions, smart contracts, user accounts & on-chain metrics. After using Etherscan for the past 4 years, no improvement has been made to the graphical user interface which I believe is the key to onboarding new users. 

#### Planned Features

* Metamask Integration
* Customised pricing data only pulling favorite coins or coins detected from their Metamask
* News articles related to favorite coins
* Community token/NFT distributed once certain milestones have been achieved
* Transaction history displayed to the user in a more visually pleasing way
